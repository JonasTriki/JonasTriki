### Hi there ![](https://i.imgur.com/6pwY3H7.gif)
I am an enthusiastic developer who loves to engage in app development, hobby projects and experiment with machine learning. I am hungry to learn and test new technology. I have completed a bachelor's degree in computer science at UiB and am taking a [master's degree in machine learning](https://www.uib.no/en/studies/MAMN-INF/MA) at UiB (graduating June 2021).
